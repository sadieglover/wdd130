            <h2>Hi, my name is Sadie!!</h2>
            <p>I am so excited that you are here! I currently live in Morgan, Utah and study at Brigham Young University - Idaho online. I am almost finished with my Bachelor’s degree in business management and absolutely love it. My entrepreneurship class back in High School introduced me to website creation and marketing, and I have been obsessed ever since. I am always studying and learning about the new marketing strategies and business improvement techniques. I am a low cost option, with the highest level of loyalty and quality. Your satisfaction is guaranteed. I am excited to work with you!</p>

            <p>You see that handsome guy in the suit. That’s my husband James. He is my biggest support and has encouraged me to go for my dreams and put myself out there. This picture was taken on the best day of my life, with the best people in my life. My life certainly isn’t perfect, but when I look at this picture it sure feels like it might be.</p>
