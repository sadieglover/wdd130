            <h2>Additional Site Maintenance</h2>
            <p>Even after proper setup, every great website requires regular maintenance for optimal performance and SEO response. Because of this we have created several options for you to choose from. Take full responsibility for updating and managing it yourself. Each site comes with 2 hours worth of tutorial and assistance from our team. We will do our best to train you in all of the vital components of keeping a website alive and healthy. If there ever comes a point where the issue is too challenging, or beyond your capacity to fix or maintain, you may request one-time assistance. We charge hourly for any assistance outside any current contracts. Hire us to maintain your site! Feel free to message us to get a quote for monthly maintenance packages. They vary based on size and complexity of the site, and how much work you need done each month. An example would be $250/month for 5 hours of maintenance and SEO work on your site. This option is great for individuals who do not want to worry about it. We will monitor your site and ensure that it is always running smoothly.</p>
