      <h3>Services</h3>

        The three main services that I provide are:
Website Setup & Design
Marketing Assistance
Additional Site Maintenance

Website Setup & Design
A stellar website and online presence make all the difference between a business that merely exists and one that thrives! Our mission is to create and enhance the online presence of small businesses through website design and functionality.
We understand the needs of small business owners and we deliver. Our sites are user friendly, functional, unique in design and structure, tailored made for your customer’s ideal experience. Not only are they easy for your customer to use, they are easy for you to use! The backend and management of the site can be learned and easily managed on your own. We also welcome you to checkout our site maintenance options below if you prefer to leave that up to us! 
This service includes everything from starting a site from the ground up to just giving your current site that needed refresh. Pricing varies greatly depending on the scope of the project. Fill out my contact form below and I will contact you to discuss pricing for your custom website!


Additional Site Maintenance
Even after proper setup, every great website requires regular maintenance for optimal performance and SEO response. Because of this we have created several options for you to choose from. 
Take full responsibility for updating and managing it yourself.
Each site comes with 2 hours worth of tutorial and assistance from our team. We will do our best to train you in all of the vital components of keeping a website alive and healthy. 
If there ever comes a point where the issue is too challenging, or beyond your capacity to fix or maintain, you may request one-time assistance. We charge hourly for any assistance outside any current contracts. 
Hire us to maintain your site! 
Feel free to message us to get a quote for monthly maintenance packages. They vary based on size and complexity of the site, and how much work you need done each month. 
An example would be $250/month for 5 hours of maintenance and SEO work on your site. 
This option is great for individuals who do not want to worry about it. We will monitor your site and ensure that it is always running smoothly. 


Marketing Assistance
Our team has a wide skillset in the digital marketing space. We can assist you in almost any marketing effort that you are taking on. Here is an example list of some of the marketing we help with on a regular basis:
Design company logos
Setup business profile on Google
Setup and manage social media accounts
Create posts and content for social media
Create and run ads (Google, Facebook, Instagram, etc)
Design print advertisements (flyer, brochures, business cards, etc)
And much more!

Because this service category is so broad, tell us below what marketing assistance it is that you need. We will get in touch and discuss what our team can do to help!

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Hi, I’m Sadie!
You see that handsome guy in the suit. That’s my husband James. He is my biggest support and has encouraged me to go for my dreams and put myself out there.
This picture was taken on the best day of my life, with the best people in my life. My life certainly isn’t perfect, but when I look at this picture it sure feels like it might be.
My background.
I currently live in Morgan, Utah and study at Brigham Young University - Idaho online. I am almost finished with my Bachelor’s degree in business management and absolutely love it.
My entrepreneurship class back in High School introduced me to website creation and marketing, and I have been obsessed ever since. I am always studying and learning about the new marketing strategies and business improvement techniques.
I am a low cost option, with the highest level of loyalty and quality. Your satisfaction is guaranteed. I am excited to work with you!
