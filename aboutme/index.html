    <p>Hey everyone! A little bit about me. I am going to be graduating in April with my degree in Business Management, and I am really excited! </p>
    <p>I currently have a website design business, however I have only been using codeless site builders so far. I'm excited to expand my understanding of html and enhance my website creation ability.</p>
    <p>I have been married for a little over a year, and in that time we have lived in three states. We started in Rexburg, Idaho for on campus school. Then we moved to Albany, New York for work. We just moved back to Morgan, Utah for the time being where we are continuing work and school remotely.</p>
    <p>I am looking forward to a great semester with all of you! Thanks!</p>
